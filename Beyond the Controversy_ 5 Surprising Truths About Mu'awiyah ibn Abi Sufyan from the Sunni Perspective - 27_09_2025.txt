Beyond the Controversy: 5 Surprising Truths About Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan from the Sunni Perspective

Introduction: Navigating a Complex Legacy

Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan is, without question, one of the most controversial figures in Islamic history. His name often stands at the center of deep-seated disagreements that have echoed through the centuries. While many conflicting narratives exist, the mainstream Sunni Islamic tradition, Ahl al-Sunnah wa l-Jamāʿah, holds a view of profound respect and nuance. This perspective is not accidental but flows from a core creedal principle ('aqīdah): the obligation to maintain a "clean heart" towards all Companions of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ.

This article invites the reader to look beyond the turmoil and explore five impactful, and perhaps surprising, truths about Mu'awiyah from the Sunni perspective. Each point serves as evidence supporting the classical Sunni stance, grounding our understanding of this complex legacy in the foundational texts and scholarly tradition of Islam.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

① His Leadership was Prophesied and Praised

The peaceful transfer of leadership from Hasan ibn Ali to Mu'awiyah was not merely a pivotal historical event; it was the fulfillment of a prophecy made and praised by the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ himself. This single event is considered by Sunni scholars to be a paramount virtue for both Hasan and Mu'awiyah.

The Prophet ﷺ, with his beloved grandson Hasan by his side, famously declared:

"This son of mine is a Sayyid , and I anticipate that Allah will bring about reconciliation, through him, between two great groups of the Muslims."

The significance of this statement is immense. The Prophet ﷺ unequivocally referred to both sides of the conflict-the supporters of Ali and Hasan, and the supporters of Mu'awiyah-as "groups of the Muslims," thereby affirming their shared faith and brotherhood despite their political differences. This has been a point of deep reflection for classical scholars for centuries, as the great Sufyān ibn ʿUyaynah said: "The prophetic statement, ‘… two parties from the Muslims,’ impresses us greatly."

This hadith serves as a crucial merit for Mu'awiyah because Hasan's abdication, an act explicitly praised by the Prophet ﷺ, legitimized his rule. The great scholar Ibn Taymiyyah explains the implication of this prophetic praise:

"The Prophet ﷺ praised Ḥasan on account of this settlement... that is due to the action of Ḥasan ibn ʿAlī being beloved to Allah and His Prophet ﷺ, and Allah and His Prophet ﷺ are pleased with it. Were the in-fighting that occurred between the Muslims that which Allah and His Prophet ﷺ instructed with, this would not have been the case... this narration is sound and unambiguous in expounding that what Ḥasan did was praiseworthy and pleasing to Allah and His Messenger ﷺ."

For Sunnis, the Prophet’s ﷺ words are a form of revelation. Therefore, his praise for Hasan’s action is seen as a divine endorsement of the outcome-the unity under Mu'awiyah's leadership, elevating the event from a politically convenient truce to a divinely sanctioned one. From this viewpoint, Mu'awiyah's leadership, established through this blessed reconciliation, saved countless Muslim lives and unified the Ummah after a period of intense strife. The year this took place was so momentous that it became known in Islamic history as the "Year of Unity" (ʿĀm al-Jamāʿah).

② He Was a Scribe Entrusted with Divine Revelation

Long before he became a political leader, Mu'awiyah held a position of immense honor and trust: he was one of the scribes of the Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. This fact directly counters narratives that seek to question the sincerity of his faith.

Mu'awiyah was appointed by the Prophet ﷺ himself to write for him. The companion Ibn 'Abbas narrated an incident from his youth:

I was a young boy running around with the other children when the Messenger of Allah ﷺ happened to approach us from behind... He patted me between my shoulders and said, “go and call Muʿāwiyah for me,” and he  scribe...

This role was not limited to letters or treaties; it included the sacred task of writing down the divine revelation (waḥī). Indeed, classical biographers and scholars narrate that the Archangel Jibrīl (Gabriel) advised the Prophet ﷺ regarding Mu'awiyah's appointment, saying:

"Appoint him as a scribe, for he is indeed trustworthy."

The trust implied by this position cannot be overstated. The Prophet ﷺ would never entrust the meticulous recording of the Qur'an-the eternal word of Allah-to an individual whose faith, integrity, and character were in any way deficient. His selection for this role is a powerful testament to his standing in the eyes of the Prophet ﷺ.

③ The Conflict Was Over Juristic Reasoning (Ijtihād), Not a Simple Power Grab

The Sunni tradition reframes the conflict between Ali ibn Abi Talib and Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan not as a simple rebellion for power, but as a tragic disagreement rooted in ijtihād-independent juristic reasoning.

It is established that Mu'awiyah never denied the virtue, merit, or right of Ali to the caliphate. His core motivation was not a personal desire for leadership but a demand for retribution (qisas) for his cousin, the third Caliph Uthman ibn Affan, who had been wrongfully and brutally murdered by rebels. As Uthman's closest kinsman in a position of authority, he was the wali al-dam, the heir with the legal standing to demand retribution.

Mu'awiyah's own position is made clear in a direct report from Abu Muslim al-Kholani, who traveled to him and asked:

“Do you dispute Ali regarding Caliphate or are you equal to him?” Mu’awiyah answered: “By Allah no. I know he is better than I am, and he has the right to rule, but do not you know that Uthman was killed as an innocent? And I am his cousin and the seeker of his revenge. Therefore go to Ali and tell him to send me Uthman’s murderers then I will obey him.”

This was a fundamental difference in ijtihād. Ali believed that establishing unity under his leadership was the first priority, after which the killers could be brought to justice. Mu'awiyah believed that justice for the slain Caliph was the immediate prerequisite before he could give his pledge of allegiance. From a Sunni perspective, the Companions were not infallible, but their intentions are assumed to be pure. The tragedy of Siffin, therefore, is not seen as a battle of good vs. evil, but a conflict between two valid, though opposing, interpretations of justice, with both parties acting on what they sincerely believed to be right.

While Sunni scholars unanimously agree that Ali's position was correct, they view Mu'awiyah as a mujtahid (one qualified to perform ijtihād) who erred in his judgment. According to the prophetic principle, a mujtahid who is correct receives two rewards, while one who errs still receives one reward for their sincere intention. He is therefore seen not as a malicious rebel fighting for worldly gain, but as a leader who made a sincere, though incorrect, juristic decision in an unprecedented and chaotic time.

④ He Was Praised by the Greatest Scholars Among the Companions

Contrary to the perception that Mu'awiyah was universally condemned by his peers, many of the most senior Companions-including those with close ties to Ali-held him in high regard, respecting his knowledge, leadership, and juristic insight.

Here are a few examples from unimpeachable sources:

• Ibn 'Abbas, the "Interpreter of the Qur'an": When someone spoke critically of Mu'awiyah's practice of praying a single-rak'ah Witr prayer, Ibn 'Abbas, a cousin of Ali and one of the foremost scholars of the Qur'an, immediately defended him, saying, "Leave him; for he is indeed a Ṣaḥābī  of the Messenger of Allah ﷺ." On another occasion, when asked about Mu'awiyah's legal reasoning, Ibn 'Abbas affirmed, "He is a faqih (i.e. a learned man who can give religious verdicts)."
• 'Abdullah ibn 'Umar: The son of the second Caliph, renowned for his piety and strict adherence to the Sunnah, gave this assessment of Mu'awiyah's political acumen: "I have not seen anyone after the Messenger of Allah ﷺ more tactful in leadership than Muʿāwiyah." When it was said to him, "what about your father?" he clarified, "my father – may Allah have mercy on him – was superior to Muʿāwiyah. However, Muʿāwiyah was more tactful in leadership than him." This is a striking admission; even the son of the revered 'Umar ibn al-Khattab acknowledged Mu'awiyah's superior political skill.
• Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas: One of the ten Companions promised Paradise, Sa'd stayed neutral during the civil strife. His evaluation of Mu'awiyah's rule was clear: "I have not seen anyone after ʿUthmān who ruled with justice than the companion of this door – meaning Muʿāwiyah."

Crucially, these praises came from individuals who were not his political partisans. Ibn 'Abbas was Ali's cousin, Ibn 'Umar was famously neutral and pious, and Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas completely abstained from the conflict. Their testimony is therefore viewed as objective and based on merit, not political alignment.

⑤ Debunking Persistent Allegations with Evidence

Several damaging allegations against Mu'awiyah have persisted through history. However, from the Sunni perspective, these claims are not supported by reliable evidence and are often contradicted by his own documented actions and the analysis of classical scholars.

Did he institute the cursing of Ali?

This claim is considered baseless within the Sunni tradition, refuted by Mu'awiyah's own recorded actions. His private reaction upon hearing of Ali's assassination, recorded by historians like Ibn 'Asakir, reveals his true estimation of the man. When his wife expressed surprise that he would weep for a man he fought, he gave a reply that reveals his true feelings:

"Indeed you do not know what the people have lost in virtue, Fiqh and knowledge ."

Furthermore, when one of his governors, Busr ibn Abī Artāt, spoke harshly about Ali in his presence, Mu'awiyah rebuked him for it. These incidents show a man who recognized the immense stature of his rival, not one who would institutionalize his defamation from the pulpits.

Did he poison Hasan ibn Ali?

This is another widespread accusation that lacks any foundation in reliable evidence. The great scholar Ibn Taymiyyah carefully assessed this claim and concluded:

"As for his statement that Muʿāwiyah had Ḥasan poisoned then this is what some people have said, but is not proven with reliable evidence or reasonable admission, nor any report which can be trusted. So this is a matter that cannot be known and any statement regarding it would be a statement without sound knowledge."

Furthermore, the jurist and historian Ibn al-'Arabi pointed out the logical inconsistency of the accusation. Hasan had already willingly and peacefully abdicated the caliphate, uniting the Muslims and removing himself as a political threat. There was simply no political incentive for Mu'awiyah to commit such a heinous act against a man who had brought about the "Year of Unity."

Conclusion: A Call for Respectful Understanding

The mainstream Sunni perspective on Mu'awiyah ibn Abi Sufyan is one of reverence for his status as a Companion and a nuanced understanding of his role as a fallible human leader. He is viewed not as a power-hungry usurper, but as a mujtahid who exercised his best judgment, a leader whose rule was prophesied and praised, a scribe entrusted with revelation, a ruler respected by his most pious peers, and a man whose character belies the ugliest allegations made against him.

Each of these points reinforces the core Sunni principle of al-imsāk ʿammā shajara bayna al-ṣaḥābah-remaining silent and refraining from delving into the disputes that arose between the Companions. We entrust their intentions to Allah and maintain a "clean heart" towards all of them. The great scholar and Caliph 'Umar ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz encapsulated this principle perfectly when asked about the Battle of Siffin:

"That is blood which Allah has kept my hands pure from; I do not wish to dye my tongue with that."

His wisdom remains the cornerstone of the Sunni path: to honor the Companions for their triumphs, to seek the best interpretation for their trials, and to entrust their ultimate state to Allah, the Most Merciful and Just.
