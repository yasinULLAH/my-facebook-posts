• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
25. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: Analogy: Pre-programmed vs. Autonomous Machine

33. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: The Inner Witness
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: The first proof of this truth is one's own heart and conscience, which can testify to the reality of these two opposing character paths. A person has been given insight into their own self.
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
34. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: Story of Ibn Tufail's `Hayy ibn Yaqdhan`

• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
35. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: The Problem of Self-Justification

36. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: Explanation for Corrupted Inner Witness
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: The inner self (`batin`) and the desiring self (`nafs`) have a reciprocal relationship. When the desiring self dominates, the inner faculty for guidance becomes dormant and corrupt, leading to self-deception.

• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: Reaching the state of `Ahsan-i-Taqweem` (the best of forms) requires effort. The default state, without conscious effort, is `Asfala Safilin` (the lowest of the low). Falling requires no effort.
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
38. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: Practicality for Youth

39. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: The Difference Between a Child and an Adult

• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
40. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: The Principle of "Being Watched"
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: The awareness of being watched (e.g., by a camera) induces restraint. This is the same principle taught by the Prophet ﷺ: act with the awareness that Allah is watching you (𝘐𝘩𝘴𝘢𝘯).
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
41. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: A Practical 20-Second Exercise
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: A simple, practical exercise is to pause for 10-20 seconds and repeat three affirmations: "Allah is watching me. Allah is listening to me. Allah is with me."
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
42. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: A 3-Minute Daily Investment
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: Repeating this 20-second exercise 10 times a day requires only about 3 minutes, yet it can transform one's life by making choices conscious.
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
43. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: The Power of Habit Formation
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: For any practice to become effective, it must become a habit. This requires consistent repetition over a period (e.g., 21, 28, 30, or 40 days).
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
44. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: Practical Tip: Using Mobile Alarms
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: A practical way to build this habit is to set 10-11 silent, vibrating alarms on a mobile phone throughout the day as reminders for the 20-second exercise.
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
45. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: Simplified Goal: Benefit vs. Harm
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: An even simpler way to apply this is to ask, "In the next hour, how can I avoid causing any harm to creation?" as the core of Allah's attributes is benevolence towards creation.
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
46. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: This Practice as a "First Step"
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: This simple exercise is the first step that opens the door to all other necessary learning (seeking knowledge, studying Seerah, etc.). It enhances focus and attention, benefiting students and professionals alike.
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
47. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: Connection to Mindfulness
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: This Islamic practice is a superior form of "mindfulness," a concept for which people in the West pay thousands of dollars in training.
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
48. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: The Cost of Ignorance
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: If a 3-minute daily investment seems too costly, one should consider the much higher price paid in stress, anxiety, depression, and wasted hours from not making it.
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
49. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: Impact on Family Life
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: This practice prevents the accumulation of stress, leading to a more peaceful family life. A conscious person entering their home will focus on giving (time, attention) rather than taking, transforming relationships.
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.
50. 𝗟𝗮𝗯𝗲𝗹: A Master Key
• 𝗦𝘂𝗺𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘆: The simple thought "Allah is watching me" is a master key that can solve numerous problems, from social media addiction to marital discord, by recalibrating one's intentions and actions.
• 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗳𝗶𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗲: Directly stated.

★ اللہ ہم سے کیا چاہتا ہے؟ اپنی زندگی کا مقصد دریافت کیجئے ★

بِسْمِ ٱللهِ ٱلرَّحْمَٰنِ ٱلرَّحِيْمِ

ایک مسلمان کی زندگی کا سب سے بڑا سوال اور سب سے گہری جستجو یہی ہوتی ہے کہ وہ ایک اچھا، ایک سچا مسلمان کیسے بنے۔ آج کے اس پرفتن دور میں جہاں ہر طرف نظریات کی بھرمار ہے، جہاں لاتعداد کتابیں اور بے شمار اسکالرز ہمیں راستہ دکھانے کی کوشش کر رہے ہیں، یہ تلاش مزید پیچیدہ ہو گئی ہے۔ ہم ایک ایسی رہنمائی کے متلاشی ہیں جو آسان ہو، عام فہم ہو، اور جس پر عمل کرکے ہم نہ صرف اپنی، بلکہ اپنے خاندان اور ایمان کی بھی حفاظت کر سکیں۔

یہ سوال کہ "اللہ ہم سے کیا چاہتا ہے؟" ہماری زندگی کے تمام پہلوؤں کا احاطہ کرتا ہے۔ یہ محض ایک مذہبی سوال نہیں، بلکہ ہماری بقا، ہماری خوشی، اطمینان اور کامیابی کا سوال ہے۔ اگر ہم اس ایک نکتے کو سمجھ لیں تو ہماری زندگی کے چھ بڑے دائرے-ذاتی، خاندانی، معاشی، سماجی، روحانی اور جسمانی-خودبخود متوازن اور بہتر ہو سکتے ہیں۔

⟪ نبوی ماڈل: زندگی گزارنے کا واحد کامل نمونہ ⟫

ہماری سب سے بڑی غلطی یہ ہے کہ ہم خود کو پہچاننے سے قاصر ہیں۔ میں کون ہوں؟ میرا وجود کیسے کام کرتا ہے؟ کون سی چیزیں مجھ پر اثرانداز ہوتی ہیں اور میں انہیں کیسے قابو کر سکتا ہوں؟ ان سوالات پر ہمارا اپنا مشاہدہ اور تجربہ انتہائی ناقص ہے۔ انسان دو حصوں پر مشتمل ہے: ایک ظاہری وجود یعنی جسم و ذہن، اور دوسرا ایک غیر مرئی، باطنی وجود۔ اس باطنی وجود کو ہم اپنی آنکھوں سے نہیں دیکھ سکتے، اسے سمجھنے کے لیے ہمیں غیب کی خبر کی ضرورت ہے، اور وہ خبر اللہ رب العزت اپنے نبی ﷺ کے ذریعے ہم تک پہنچاتا ہے۔

یہی نبوی ماڈل (Prophetic Model) ہے۔ اسے سمجھنا اور اس پر عمل کرنا ہماری مجبوری ہے، کوئی اختیار نہیں۔ اس کے بغیر ہماری شناخت ہی ادھوری ہے۔ جیسے ایک سیلف ڈرائیونگ کار کو چلنے کے لیے اپنے مرکزی نظام سے منسلک رہنا ضروری ہے، اسی طرح ہمارے باطنی وجود کا تعلق جب تک اپنے خالق سے استوار نہ ہو، ہمارا ظاہری وجود بے ترتیب اور بھٹکا ہوا رہتا ہے۔

آج کی دنیا مختلف پیمانوں (Quotients) کی بات کرتی ہے۔ پہلے انٹیلیجنس کوشنٹ (IQ) تھا، پھر ایموشنل کوشنٹ (EQ) آیا، پھر اسپریچوئل کوشنٹ (SQ) اور اب سوشل کوشنٹ (SQ) کی بھی بات ہو رہی ہے۔ یہ انسانی ماڈلز ہمیشہ نامکمل رہیں گے اور ان میں ترمیم ہوتی رہے گی۔ ہماری مختصر زندگی اس بات کی متحمل نہیں ہو سکتی کہ ہم تجربے اور غلطی (Trial and Error) سے سیکھیں۔ کامیابی کا یقینی راستہ وہی ہے جو کامل اور پہلے سے آزمودہ ہے-یعنی نبوی ماڈل۔

⟪ ہمارا اصل مقصد: محض بقا یا اللہ کی خلافت؟ ⟫

اگر ہم اپنی زندگی کا تجزیہ کریں تو معلوم ہو گا کہ ہمیں دو بنیادی جذبے متحرک کرتے ہیں: کسی نقصان کا خوف اور کسی فائدے کی لالچ۔ یہی دو جذبے جانوروں، پرندوں، حشرات اور حتیٰ کہ پودوں کو بھی چلاتے ہیں۔ ایک انگور کی بیل بھی سہارے کی تلاش میں اپنا رخ موڑ لیتی ہے اور خطرے (مثلاً آگ) سے بچنے کے لیے دوسری سمت بڑھنے لگتی ہے۔ اگر ہماری زندگی کے مقاصد بھی یہی بنیادی بقا کی جبلتیں ہیں تو پھر ہم اپنی برتری کو کیسے ثابت کریں گے؟

قرآن مجید ایسے لوگوں کی مثال جانوروں جیسی دیتا ہے، بلکہ ان سے بھی بدتر۔ ہمارا حقیقی مقصد اس سے کہیں بلند ہے۔ جب اللہ ﷻ نے حضرت آدم علیہ السلام کی تخلیق کا ارادہ فرمایا تو فرشتوں سے کہا:

◆ "إِنِّي جَاعِلٌ فِي الْأَرْضِ خَلِيفَةً" ◆
ترجمہ: ”میں زمین میں ایک خلیفہ (نائب) بنانے والا ہوں۔“ (البقرۃ: 30)

ہمارا مقصدِ تخلیق اللہ کا نائب اور خلیفہ بننا ہے۔ جب ہم یہ سمجھ جائیں گے کہ ہم اللہ کے نائب کیسے بن سکتے ہیں، تو ہماری ہر حرکت، ہر عمل عبادت بن جائے گا، اور یہ عبادت 24 گھنٹے جاری رہے گی۔

⟪ اللہ کے نائب کیسے بنیں؟ اس کی صفات کا عکس بن کر ⟫

اللہ ﷻ کو اپنی ذات یا نظامِ کائنات چلانے کے لیے کسی نائب کی ضرورت نہیں۔ وہ الحی القیوم ہے۔ خلافت دراصل اللہ کی صفات میں نیابت کا نام ہے۔ اللہ ﷻ اپنی مخلوق سے اپنی صفات کا اظہار چاہتا ہے۔ جب وہ مخلوق پر رحم کرتا ہے تو اس کی صفت "الرحیم" ظاہر ہوتی ہے۔ جب وہ معاف کرتا ہے تو "الغفور" کی تجلی ہوتی ہے۔

اللہ ﷻ کو اپنی صفات سے بے حد محبت ہے، اور وہ چاہتا ہے کہ اس کی مخلوق، یعنی ہم انسان، اپنی مرضی اور اختیار سے ان صفات کو اپنے کردار اور عمل میں منعکس کریں۔ اسی لیے ہمیں "اختیار" کی امانت دی گئی۔ جس انسان میں اللہ کی صفات کا جتنا زیادہ عکس ہو گا، وہ اللہ کے اتنا ہی قریب اور اس کا محبوب ہو گا۔

ہمارے نبی اکرم ﷺ اللہ کی صفات کا کامل ترین انسانی نمونہ ہیں۔ اسی لیے وہ اللہ کے سب سے محبوب ہیں۔ ہمیں حکم دیا گیا:

◆ "قُلْ إِن كُنتُمْ تُحِبُّونَ اللَّهَ فَاتَّبِعُونِي يُحْبِبْكُمُ اللَّهُ" ◆
ترجمہ: ”(اے نبی ﷺ) کہہ دیجئے! اگر تم اللہ سے محبت کرتے ہو تو میری اتباع کرو، اللہ تم سے محبت کرے گا۔“ (آل عمران: 31)

جب ہم آپ ﷺ کی اتباع میں سچ بولتے ہیں تو اللہ کی صفت "الحق" کا عکس بنتے ہیں۔ جب کسی کو معاف کرتے ہیں تو "العفو" اور "الغفور" کے مظہر بنتے ہیں۔ جب کسی کے عیب پر پردہ ڈالتے ہیں تو "الستار" کی صفت اپناتے ہیں۔ اس کے برعکس جب ہم جھوٹ، ظلم، یا غیبت کا راستہ اختیار کرتے ہیں تو ہم شیطانی صفات کو اپنے اندر ڈاؤن لوڈ کر رہے ہوتے ہیں۔

⟪ عملی تبدیلی کا راستہ: صرف 20 سیکنڈ کی ایک مشق ⟫

یہ تمام فلسفہ بہت خوبصورت ہے، لیکن سوال یہ ہے کہ عملی زندگی میں اسے کیسے نافذ کیا جائے؟ خاص طور پر آج کا نوجوان، جو فوری نتائج چاہتا ہے، اس راستے پر کیسے چلے؟

اس کا طریقہ اتنا آسان اور طاقتور ہے کہ اسے ایک چھوٹا بچہ بھی اپنا سکتا ہے اور ایک بزرگ بھی۔ یہ راستہ آگاہی (Awareness) سے شروع ہوتا ہے۔ ایک بالغ شخص اور بچے میں بنیادی فرق یہی ہے کہ بالغ شخص کو یہ احساس ہوتا ہے کہ "میں کون ہوں اور میں کہاں ہوں"۔ اسی احساس کی وجہ سے وہ ضبط اور تحمل کا مظاہرہ کرتا ہے۔ کیمرے کی موجودگی کا احساس ہمیں محتاط کر دیتا ہے۔ یہی اصول اللہ کے ساتھ ہمارے تعلق پر بھی لاگو ہوتا ہے۔

یہ وہ مقام ہے جسے حدیثِ جبریل میں "احسان" کہا گیا ہے۔ حضرت جبریل علیہ السلام نے جب نبی اکرم ﷺ سے پوچھا کہ احسان کیا ہے، تو آپ ﷺ نے فرمایا:

❝ ”تم اللہ کی عبادت اس طرح کرو گویا تم اسے دیکھ رہے ہو، اور اگر تم اسے نہیں دیکھ رہے تو (یقین رکھو کہ) وہ تمہیں دیکھ رہا ہے۔“ (صحیح مسلم، کتاب الایمان، حدیث 8) ❞

اس کیفیت کو اپنی زندگی میں لانے کے لیے ایک سادہ سی عملی مشق کی جا سکتی ہے:

دن میں صرف 10 بار، ہر بار 20 سیکنڈ کے لیے آنکھیں بند کر کے یا کھلی آنکھوں سے ہی پوری توجہ کے ساتھ صرف تین جملے دل میں دہرائیں اور ان کا تصور کریں:

❝ ◆ اللہ مجھے دیکھ رہا ہے۔ ◆ ❞
❝ ◆ اللہ مجھے سن رہا ہے۔ ◆ ❞
❝ ◆ اللہ میرے ساتھ ہے۔ ◆ ❞

یہ مشق دن بھر میں آپ کے صرف 3 سے 4 منٹ لے گی۔ صبح بستر سے اٹھتے ہی، کام کے دوران، گاڑی چلاتے ہوئے، یا کسی بھی لمحے یہ کیا جا سکتا ہے۔ اس کے لیے اپنے موبائل پر 10 خاموش الارم (وائبریشن پر) لگا لیں جو آپ کو یاد دہانی کراتے رہیں۔

جب آپ یہ مشق کریں گے تو آپ کی ترجیحات خودبخود بدلنا شروع ہو جائیں گی۔ آپ کے فیصلے باشعور ہو جائیں گے۔ آپ کا ہر عمل اس پیمانے پر پرکھا جائے گا کہ کیا یہ اس اللہ کی مرضی کے مطابق ہے جو مجھے دیکھ رہا ہے؟ نفسیات کہتی ہے کہ کسی بھی عمل کو عادت بنانے کے لیے 21 سے 40 دن کی مسلسل تکرار ضروری ہے۔ اگر آپ صرف 30 دن اس 90 منٹ کی سرمایہ کاری (3 منٹ روزانہ) کو اپنی زندگی میں شامل کر لیں، تو یہ آپ کی شخصیت میں ایک ناقابلِ یقین انقلاب برپا کر سکتی ہے۔

یہ چھوٹی سی مشق دراصل "مائنڈفلنیس" (Mindfulness) کی سب سے اعلیٰ شکل ہے، جس کی تربیت کے لیے لوگ مغرب میں ہزاروں ڈالر خرچ کرتے ہیں۔ یہ آپ کی توجہ اور ارتکاز کو بڑھائے گی، طالب علموں کی کارکردگی بہتر کرے گی، ذہنی دباؤ اور پریشانی کو کم کرے گی، اور خاندانی رشتوں میں مٹھاس لائے گی۔ جب ایک شوہر اس احساس کے ساتھ گھر میں داخل ہو گا کہ اللہ مجھے دیکھ رہا ہے، تو وہ اپنے اہل و عیال کے حقوق پر توجہ دے گا۔ جب بیوی اس شعور کے ساتھ جیئے گی تو وہ اپنے شوہر کی ضروریات کا خیال رکھے گی۔ یوں ایک محفوظ اور پرامن گھرانے کی بنیاد پڑے گی۔

یہ وہ پہلا قدم ہے جو دین کے علم اور سیرت کے مطالعے سمیت ہر دوسرے نیک عمل کے دروازے کھول دے گا۔

⟪ اہم نکات ⟫

• ◆ نبوی ماڈل کو سمجھیں: ◆ زندگی گزارنے کے لیے انسانی تجربات اور نظریات پر انحصار کرنے کے بجائے نبوی ماڈل کو اپنی زندگی کی بنیاد بنائیں کیونکہ یہ کامل اور الہامی ہے۔
• ◆ اپنا اصل مقصد پہچانیں: ◆ آپ کی تخلیق کا مقصد محض دنیاوی فوائد حاصل کرنا یا نقصانات سے بچنا نہیں، بلکہ زمین پر اللہ ﷻ کے نائب کی حیثیت سے اس کی صفات (رحم، عدل، عفو، صدق) کو اپنے کردار میں منعکس کرنا ہے۔
• ◆ عبادت کا تصور وسیع کریں: ◆ عبادت صرف نماز، روزہ تک محدود نہیں۔ جب آپ اللہ کی نیابت کے شعور کے ساتھ ہر کام کریں گے تو آپ کا سونا، جاگنا، کمانا اور اہل خانہ کے ساتھ وقت گزارنا بھی عبادت بن جائے گا۔
• ◆ احسان کی کیفیت پیدا کریں: ◆ ہر عمل اس گہرے احساس کے ساتھ کریں کہ اللہ ﷻ آپ کو دیکھ رہا ہے، سن رہا ہے اور آپ کے ساتھ ہے۔ یہ احساس آپ کو گناہوں سے بچائے گا اور نیکی کی طرف راغب کرے گا۔
• روزانہ 𝟯 منٹ کی مشق اپنائیں: دن میں 10 بار، 20 سیکنڈ کے لیے "اللہ مجھے دیکھ رہا ہے، سن رہا ہے، میرے ساتھ ہے" کا تصور کریں۔ اس عادت کو پختہ کرنے کے لیے موبائل الارم کا استعمال کریں۔
• ◆ اپنی ترجیحات کا تعین کریں: ◆ ہر گھنٹے کے آغاز میں چند سیکنڈ کے لیے سوچیں کہ اگلے گھنٹے میں ایسا کیا کروں جس سے مخلوق کو فائدہ پہنچے یا کم از کم میری ذات سے کسی کو تکلیف نہ پہنچے۔
• ◆ نیت اور کوشش پر توجہ دیں: ◆ اگر آپ اس راستے پر چلنے میں بار بار ناکام بھی ہوں تو ہمت نہ ہاریں۔ اللہ ﷻ آپ کی نیت اور مسلسل کوشش کو دیکھتا ہے اور وہی اس کا اجر دے گا۔
• ◆ علم کے دروازے کھولیں: ◆ یہ عملی مشق آپ کے اندر مزید جاننے کی پیاس پیدا کرے گی، جس سے آپ قرآن، حدیث اور سیرت کا مطالعہ کرنے کی طرف خودبخود مائل ہوں گے۔

⟪ ملفوظات ⟫

• زندگی اتنی مختصر ہے کہ اسے تجربات کی بھینٹ نہیں چڑھایا جا سکتا؛ کامل نمونہ موجود ہے، اسے اپنا لیجیے۔
• اگر آپ کی زندگی کے مقاصد وہی ہیں جو ایک جانور کے ہیں، تو آپ اپنی انسانیت کا حق ادا نہیں کر رہے۔
• اللہ کا نائب بننے کا مطلب اس کی صفات کا عکس بننا ہے۔
• ہر لمحہ آپ یا تو رحمانی صفات ڈاؤن لوڈ کر رہے ہیں یا شیطانی۔ انتخاب آپ کا ہے۔
• جو عمل کرو یہ سوچ کر کرو کہ اللہ تمہیں دیکھ رہا ہے؛ یہی احسان ہے اور یہی کامیابی کی کنجی ہے۔
• روزانہ صرف 3 منٹ کی روحانی سرمایہ کاری آپ کو گھنٹوں کے ذہنی دباؤ سے بچا سکتی ہے۔
• جب آپ دینے پر توجہ مرکوز کرتے ہیں تو رشتے خودبخود مضبوط ہو جاتے ہیں۔
• یہ مت سوچیں کہ کیا حاصل کرنا ہے، یہ سوچیں کہ اللہ کی کون سی صفت کا مظہر بننا ہے۔

⟪ خلاصہ ⟫

ہماری زندگی کا حقیقی مقصد اللہ ﷻ کی خلافت کا حق ادا کرنا ہے، جس کا راستہ اس کی صفات کو اپنے کردار میں اپنانا ہے۔ یہ مقصد صرف فلسفیانہ نہیں بلکہ انتہائی عملی ہے۔ نبی اکرم ﷺ نے ہمیں "احسان" کا تصور دے کر اس کا عملی طریقہ بھی سکھا دیا ہے کہ ہم ہر لمحہ اللہ کو حاضر و ناظر جان کر زندگی گزاریں۔ روزانہ چند منٹ کی ایک سادہ سی مشق-"اللہ مجھے دیکھ رہا ہے، سن رہا ہے، میرے ساتھ ہے"-ہماری سوچ، ہمارے فیصلوں اور ہمارے اعمال میں انقلابی تبدیلی لا سکتی ہے۔ یہ پہلا قدم ہمیں ذہنی سکون، خاندانی خوشحالی، اور دنیا و آخرت کی کامیابی کی راہ پر گامزن کر سکتا ہے، بشرطیکہ ہم خلوصِ نیت اور استقامت کے ساتھ اسے اپنی عادت بنا لیں۔
